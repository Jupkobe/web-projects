# My Web Projects

### Todo App (Tailwind CSS)

This is a basic too application project. You can add/delete/complete your todos. Your todos stored in local storage so you don't lose them when refreshed. I used tailwind in this project so UI theme changes based on user's preferences.

### Current Time (Tailwind CSS)

This projects uses dayjs module to guess user's time zone and show the exact time.

Time zones can be changed with the button next to the current time zone. Zones are fetched from WorldTimeApi.
